## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 1: Must use safe parser (simpleeval/asteval) instead of eval() to avoid security vulnerabilities
- Phase 1: Must use Decimal module for precision arithmetic to eliminate float representation errors
- Phase 2: Angle mode system critical for correct trigonometric calculations

### Pending Todos

[From .planning/todos/pending/ — ideas captured during sessions]

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

[Issues that affect future work]

- Phase 1: Need to select safe expression parser library (simpleeval vs asteval vs custom) — research during planning
- Phase 3: Angle mode state management needs design (global vs per-function)
